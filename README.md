# tonelib-zoom-apptainer

This is a containerization of ToneLib-Zoom, a freeware editor for various Zoom guitar and bass effects pedals. Tonelib has not updated it in quite some time and it has begun to get buggy on newer ditributions of Linux. However, it works fine on Ubuntu 20.04 still.

The container uses apptainer which can be found here: https://apptainer.org/

Once Apptainer is installed, you should be able to download the sif file and execute it from the terminal by naviating to the directory containing the sif file and using ./tonelib.sif
